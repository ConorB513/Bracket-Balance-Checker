# BracketChecker

Bracker balance checker algorithm using a stack to ensure that a given file has balanced brackets

## Description

Written in C++ and created for my data structures and programming class, this project contains three things. First is an implementation of a doubly linked list with classes for both each node of the doubly linked
list and the doubly linked list as a whole. second is a basic stack data structure created using a doubly linked list. Third is the algorithm (defined in main) that reads in a file and checks to ensure a given file
has balanced brackets. 

## Topics
